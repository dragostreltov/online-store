== *Getting started*

This document explains how to successfully call the Online Shop API with your app/browser. It assumes you are familiar with API usage and know how to perform REST API calls.

=== *Before you start*

=== *User registration*

In order to create an account, you will access the user registration path:

....
http://localhost:8080/user
....

Required fields:
....
username: {user}
password: {password}
....

Example request of account creation for a user with:

operation::register-test-consumer[snippets='curl-request,http-request,http-response']

|Error code |Description

|400 Bad Request
|Required fields were invalid, not specified or violated constraints(ex. username not being unique)

=== *User authentication*

Online Shop supports HTTP Basic authentication. This allows you to protect the URLs so that only you and Online Shop can access them. In order to authenticate with HTTP, you may provide a username and password with the following format:

Using cURL:
....
curl -u USERNAME:[password] ...
....

Example request:
....
curl -u test_user:test_pwd 'http://localhost:8080/categs' -i -X GET

Using any API testing application, before sending any request:

....
Authorization -> Type: Basic Auth
....

== *Exploring the APIs*

All the shop's products are sorted by categories and subcategories, which any authenticated and authorized user will navigate through in order to check products. If the user wants to purchase a product, it can be added to a shopping list.

The user can create and manage multiple lists (wishlists). When a shopping list is finished, the user can proceed to the checkout page, which displays the total cost and offers the possibility of applying a discount coupon (if any are available).
