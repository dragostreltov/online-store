== *Notes for Developers*

=== *Regarding the use of project*

If you wish to clone/fork and work on the project, you can use/test any feature using the *admin* account for authentication:
....
username: admin
password: admin
....
Same credentials can be used for access inside the database:
....
H2 console
http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
....

The consumer documentation includes only features that can be accessed by users with "ROLE_USER".
Those features were imported in this document. Furthermore, all the API's features are explained here. 
Using the API's registration feature you can only create accounts with "ROLE_USER". If you need additional "ROLE_ADMIN" users, you can create via SQL query inside _/online-store/src/main/resources/data.sql_, table USER.

=== *Regarding documentation snippets*

The snippets used inside the documentation are auto updated by their respective *unit tests*.

In order to generate snippets from a new device (cloned/forked project), you have to run all unit tests. Then you'll find the snippets at _/online-store/target/generated-snippets_.
The source document for generating .html docs must be placed inside  _/online-store/src/main/asciidoc_ with .adoc format. This is where I wrote the whole documentation and organized snippets.
To generate the .html document, you must run "mvn package" or Run as -> Maven build... -> Goals: package

Some of the _consumer related_ routes/features have custom snippets with suffix "-consumer", which are *NOT* auto updated (I created them on my machine and are ignored by git).
This is because some details/parameters used for executing methods must be hidden from the consumer, and the auto generated snippets contain all the used parameters.

=== *Regarding API calls*

All the admin features displayed here use the default "-test" snippets, so please take into consideration the following when performing API calls:

When sending *POST* requests, Hibernate auto-assigns an ID and other needed empty/null parameters to the created object (to pass the constructor), so you don't need to specify them inside API request body.

When sending *PUT* requests, the methods are implemented to conserve all the unchanged details of the edited object, so you don't need to specify all of them.

Example for user registration:

include::{snippets}/register-test/curl-request.adoc[]

This is what the service receives at the end, but all input (except user and password) is auto-assigned.

Example for subcategory creation:

include::{snippets}/create-subcategory-test/curl-request.adoc[]

The object always gets assigned an empty list of products, to pass the constructor. You can add the products too, if you want, but I recommend using the existing service for this. 

== *Getting started*

This document explains how to successfully call the Online Shop API with your app/browser. It assumes you are familiar with API usage and know how to perform REST API calls.

=== *Before you start*

You will need an user account in order to get access to the API's features.

=== *User registration*

In order to create an account, you will access the user registration path:

....
http://localhost:8080/user
....

Required fields:
....
username: {user}
password: {password}
....

Example request of account creation for a user with:

operation::register-test-consumer[snippets='curl-request,http-request,http-response']

Possible errors:
[cols="2,5"]
|===
|Error code |Description

|400 Bad Request
|Required fields were invalid, not specified or violated constraints(ex. username not being unique)
|===

=== *User authentication*

Online Shop supports HTTP Basic authentication. This allows you to protect the URLs so that only you and Online Shop can access them. In order to authenticate with HTTP, you may provide a username and password with the following format:

Using cURL:
....
curl -u USERNAME:[password] ...
....

Example request:
....
curl -u test_user:test_pwd 'http://localhost:8080/categs' -i -X GET

[{"id":101,"name":"Telefoane, Tablete"},{"id":102,"name":"Gaming, Jocuri"}]
....

Using any API testing application, before sending any request:

....
Authorization -> Type: Basic Auth
....

== *Exploring the APIs*

All the products under the shop are sorted by categories and subcategories, which any registered user will navigate through in order to check a product. Then, if the user wants to purchase said product, it can be added in a shopping list. The user can manage multiple lists.
